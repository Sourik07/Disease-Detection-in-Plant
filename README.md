# Disease-Detection-in-Plant
The study will concentrate on automating disease detection from the leaves using the Pre-Trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. 
The dataset used in the experiment was obtained from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset.

The suggested framework seeks to improve agricultural practices' effectiveness, precision, and sustainability by analyzing the dataset and using cutting-edge deep learning algorithms.
